# # The user enters a name.
#
# You print user name in reverse (should begin with capital letter)
# then extra text: ",a thorough mess is it not ", then the first name of the user name then "?"
#
# Example:
#
# Enter: Valdis -> Output: Sidlav, a thorough mess is it not V?
# 
name = input('Please enter your name! ')
print(name)

## Exercise Nr.2 Write a program to recognize a text symbol
# The user (first player) enters the text.
# Only asterisks instead of letters are output.
# Assume that there are no numbers, but there may be spaces.
# The user (i.e. the other player) enters the symbol.
# If the letter is found, then the letter is displayed in ALL the appropriate places, all other letters remain asterisks.
# Example:
# First input: KartupeÄ¼u lauks -> ********* *****
# Second input: a -> *a****** *a***

# 3. Text conversion

# Write a program for text conversion

# Save user input

# Print the entered text without changes

# Exception: if the words in the input are not .... bad, 
# then the output is not ...  bad section must be changed to is good

# Examples:

# The weather is not bad -> The weather is good

# The car is not new -> The car is not new

# This cottage cheese is not so bad -> This cottage cheese is good 

# Hints:

# Find (or index, or even rfind) will probably come in handy, as may an operator. Also slice syntax will be useful.

# Extra: How would you do this task in Latvian language (nav slikts/a -> ir labs/a)?
